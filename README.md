# Greedy spike selection

Small toolkit that employs a greedy algorithm to select amino acid sequences (e.g., CoV spike sequences) to iteratively maximize positional diversity. When no sequence can increase diversity further, ties break by total [Hamming distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance) to the already selected set.

## Quick start

Install and run via

```bash
>>> pip install git+https://github.com/emkeeler/greedy_spike_selection.git
>>> greedy-select -n number_of_sequences_to_select /path/to/data.csv
```

Input CSVs should follow the following layout:
* the first column holds sequence IDs
* all other columns hold aligned residues (one column per position)

E.g., the first row may be `LMH03f,G,V,Y,S,V,S,...`, the second `16s,G,V,Y,S,V,S,...`, and so on. Indels are signified by a `-`. See [here](data/hku5_lin1_all.csv) for an example.

### Selecting sequences

The greedy pass keeps a running tally of which residues have been observed at each alignment column. At every step it scans the remaining sequences and picks the one that would introduce the largest number of unseen residues. If several sequences tie, the algorithm chooses the sequence whose total Hamming distance to the already selected set is greatest.

#### Diversity score

For a chosen subset of sequences, the diversity score is the sum over all alignment columns of the number of unique residues observed in that column. A perfectly diverse subset of length `L` sequences and `P` positions would score `L Ã— P` (all residues distinct at each position).

### Command usage

```bash
usage: greedy-select [-h] [-n N_SELECT] [--start-with START_WITH [START_WITH ...]] [--plot-greedy] [--plot-pairwise] [--figure-dir FIGURE_DIR] csv_path

Select diverse sequences and optionally create visualizations.

positional arguments:
  csv_path              path to the alignment csv file

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -n N_SELECT, --n-select N_SELECT
                        number of sequences to select
  --start-with START_WITH [START_WITH ...]
                        identifiers to pre-select before greedy selection
  --plot-greedy         generate the greedy selection growth plot
  --plot-pairwise       generate the pairwise difference heatmap
  --figure-dir FIGURE_DIR
                        directory where figures will be written
```

The CLI prints the chosen sequence identifiers. If `--plot-greedy` or `--plot-pairwise` is given, PNGs will be saved to `figs/` (or the directory set with `--figure-dir`).

### Example output

```bash
>>> greedy-select --start-with LMH03f NV-SD-L1 20s 17s -n 15 data/hku5_lin1_all.csv
Selected 15 sequences with diversity score 813 (max possible is 3765):
* LMH03f
* NV-SD-L1
* 20s
* 17s

```

#### Greedy diversity growth

This plot compares cumulative diversity across the greedy subset and a random subset of the same size. Diversity is the count of unique residues observed at each aligned position.

The heatmap shows pairwise Hamming distances for all sequences in the CSV, with bold borders and labels marking the selected subset.
